# Cakeslicer

The idea behind this project is to serve as a substitute for Cookiecutter for starting new projects from a starter monorepo, replacing default values and variables and removing code blocks that aren't needed based on the inputs from the user.

The documentation will be more developed soon.

At the moment, what is available is only a diagram of the project's structure:
